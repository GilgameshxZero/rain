    <h1>Some thoughts</h1>
    <p>One might argue that Georgia is a better web font choice than Garamond as it was designed <i>for the web</i>. I,
      however, dream of a day that technological advances in PPI will enable Garamond to be a viable web font even with
      its cluttered appearance.</p>
    <p>This webpage, however, is still written in Georgia. Luckily, it's purpose is not to discuss the differences
      between these two fonts. Rather, it is to demonstrate smooth CSS-only gradient animations.</p>
    <p>The following is all the relevant CSS for the gradient animation.</p>
    <pre><code>body {
  background-image: linear-gradient(to right, #2980B9 0%, #6DD5FA 25%, #FFFFFF 50%, #6DD5FA 75%, #2980B9 100%);
  background-size: 200% 100%;

  animation: gradient-animation 5s linear infinite;
}

@keyframes gradient-animation {
  0% {
    background-position: 0 0;
  }

  100% {
    background-position: 200% 0;
  }
}</code></pre>
  </div>
</body>
