  <h1>Oh, Garamond</h1>
  <p>One might argue that Georgia is a better web font choice than Garamond as it was designed <i>for the web</i>. I, however, find the lower x-height of Garamond an irresitable alstroemeria to which the buzzing of my inner designer inevitably gravitates.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, this webpage is still written in Georgia. Luckily, it's primary use is to demonstrate smooth CSS-only gradient animations, as well as a styling method where every length is based on the <code>rem</code> specifier. This <code>rem</code> specification allows for some easy responsive constraints, which I shall not demonstrate today.</p>
